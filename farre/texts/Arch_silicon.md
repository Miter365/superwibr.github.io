They have phones now. Damn.
This probably doesn't seem like much to you, but on Polarius, mobile devices are a luxury. If it isn't bolted down, tied with arm-thick wires and monitored more closely than an unstable interdimensional gateway it's probably toast in a few months.
Except for the new Bracket 1 made by the riches' thing inventors up in NINE. They can have phones, and they don't even work for it.
No, we from MIRE must scavenge for good ice plates to replace our bullet-shattered windows and buy what gas canisters we can with our last remaining credits so we don't die of frostbite.
I *do* have some friends from NINE, but "Friend" is a loose word, especially ever since the hopclock tower was installed. They're constantly calling their family back on Destiny, impatiently awaiting the return ships.
Oh yeah, they get to go back home. Ten years, get education, toughen you up, here's how the mining is going. Then, home.
Meanwhile, all my family is either dead or stuck in a cave.
This has to change. I've decided it. If I can get enough money, I can live with the rich. I can't go to Destiny, though -- I'm bound to this godforsaken frost ballbearing until I find love to become "A valuable member of the population". Oh I've found love, alright, just not the kind this pitifully reactionary society wants me to have. I've saved up, bought a drill, a portable container and a flashlight. Down to FRACTO we go!

A rumbling clank makes me jump; the vault doors just closed. I'm stuck in here until I can pay for my exit. Wandering around a big spiky ice pillar bears fruit: someone's portable matter compressor got stuck on one of the spines. Free storage! I swing my drill left and right, shards of water crystallized over millennia being ripped from hard snow to glide through the air and be shrunk and absorbed by the compressor. In my careless hopping, I almost ran face first into a big metal wall. No, not a wall... A stationary drilling unit, and for silicon at that! The cost of these light grey slabs has gone up considerably since the phone production started, and this unit's storage is full and ready to be taken! It can't be this easy, can it? A quick navigation of the interface proves it is. I run from where I came with excitement: I have on me the value necessary to secure a job, a phone, a house, and a purely transactional husband! That excitement is short winded though, as my jigging skip shatters the ground beneath me as I crash through the thin ice.
Great, now I'm half way to FERRI. As I push to get out of a pile of snow, I hear a husky voice call to me:

"Ya allreit', lad?"

A mining supervisor pulls me up to my feet and dusts off the snow from my coat. After looking at me, he pauses.

"Yer ain't no lad, lass! What'cher doin' down 'ere? Go take ye lift o'er there, giv's habit back to yer brother n' leave the back-breakin' work to togh-boned men like the kinds of meself!", he says, pushing me by the back towards a pair of sad-looking scuffed and rusty iron doors. Turns out that elevator leaded straight to the trade office, where I put in all my equipment and storage to get all my credits transfered straight into my new and shiny NINE bank account. Now to plan my departure of this warded metal rock, with enough cash to truly go places
