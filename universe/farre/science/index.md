# Science & Magic

## Sciences
- {science}:: The usual sciences of the modern world.
- {thaumaturgy}:: A calculated approach to otherwise inexplicable forces.
- {biomancy}:: A cross between thaumaturgy and biology. Used to create purpose-fit creatures or Remaking.

## Magics
- {Draíbriste}:: Unpredictable and dangerous forces that tamper with the balance of universal forces, canalized from matter that exists between realities.
- {Merzost}:: Bending the creation at the heart of the world. More broken but more predictable than Draíbriste.
- {Magick}:: The mind is a powerful tool. Works by the common agreement of rules to be followed. Truthful oaths are an example of naturally occurring Magick.
