	<br>
	<p class="lore-unknown">&gt; ???</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; Arc Thrower</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> This newer weapon has only been recovered once, attached to a mutant Derelict, and is
		surprisingly effective for Derelict Weaponry. It is similar to the arc projector, but fires multiple weaker arcs
		for a chance to quickly shut down more than one target system. Interestingly, arc throwers do not show signs of
		usual Derelict construction, thus their origin is still a mystery. </p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; Archives</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> A decommissioned network hub formerly connected to Complex 0b1. It is now linked to the Cetus
		Mainframe and used as a backup.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; Battle Rifle</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> A prime example of Derelict Weaponry, the common Battle Rifle and its heavy variant have
		greater damage potential than other ballistic weapons of their class, but at the same time suffer from
		inconsistent application of force at the point of impact, leading to less effective results under some
		conditions. Nonetheless, quite a few Derelicts rely on it as a primary or secondary weapon.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-unknown">&gt; ???</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; Blade Trap</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> A simple trap mechanism, though the effectiveness of forcibly detaching target components is
		not to be underestimated where hostile forces are incapable of rebuilding in the field.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-unknown">&gt; ???</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; Caves</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> Approximately 15% of the subsurface cave systems surrounding Complex 0b1 were incorporated
		into the initial construction of Complex 0b10, but many more remain untouched. These caves are occupied by
		Derelict robots. Recent activity suggests there could be more substantial populations deeper in the caves.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-unknown">&gt; ???</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; Chute Trap</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> Short one-way channels from the primary Factory levels into Waste subzones. While normally
		used to dispose of larger scrap, the entrances to these channels are hidden such that they can also serve as
		Traps. If triggered by a hostile robot, the channel is permanently sealed from within to prevent escape, and is
		then relocated to a new area so that trap locations cannot be perfectly mapped.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-unknown">&gt; ???</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; Combat Hover Systems</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> As future engagements in off-world locations could very well involve traversing more hostile
		terrain than seen here on Tau Ceti IV, in order to bring heavier ground-based firepower to bear a new line of
		combat-oriented hover systems are under development. These include built-in armor and can support nearly as much
		mass as legs, though move somewhat more slowly than standard hover systems. Demolishers are the first to rely on
		this technology, but more classes have entered the testing phase as well.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; Complex 0b1</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> Primary subterranean facilities below the faux Human city, developed over the several decades
		following deployment of Project Seraph in 2211. Surrounding the complex are cave systems and old mining tunnels
		now populated by Derelicts.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; Complex 0b10</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> New subterranean complex under construction below the Leopard landing site, providing quicker
		access to the battle site and ship itself. The complex is divided into three primary levels--Materials, Factory,
		and Research--with a design focused on efficient development and production of advanced defensive forces.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-unknown">&gt; ???</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; Cooled Power Sources</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> Among the prototype power sources are cooled variants capable of being pushed to double their
		energy output at the cost of possibly suffering temporary shutdowns and weakened structural integrity. No robot
		designs currently employ this technology, but it is being developed as a theoretical way to support vastly more
		powerful shield generators, or applied in other areas where only short but powerful bursts of energy are
		required.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-unknown">&gt; ???</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-unknown">&gt; ???</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; DSF</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> Distributed Storage Facility. An area designated for storage of materials and components.
		Distribution serves two purposes, making local access to resources easier while also minimizing losses in the
		event that one is compromised.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; Derelict</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> A generic term for the many partially functioning and/or errant robots that exist in the
		Caves and Mines surrounding Complex 0b1. Some are failed experiments, others are common robots glitched beyond
		repair. In some cases they may communicate with one another and exhibit rudimentary forms of organization, or
		have developed robotic ecosystems of their own. While I could do more to control their spread, they generally
		don't cause too much trouble nor pose much of a threat, and I find them an interesting study in robotic
		evolution. I did unfortunately have to displace some of my favorite Derelict populations during the construction
		of Complex 0b10.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; Derelict Prototype</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> While a majority of Derelict robots are old variants of my own creation, in some cases with
		minor alterations, reports suggest a growing number of completely new robots under development by the so-called
		Tinkerers. This is likely in response to the threat Derelict communities perceive in the expansion of Complex
		0b10. The Knight, Troll, Dragon, and Hydra classes are especially interesting.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-unknown">&gt; ???</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; Derelict Weaponry</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> Wherever possible Derelict robots tend to salvage and use discarded technology from my
		operations, but more recently they have begun to develop weapon systems of their own, showing a keen fascination
		with melee combat and unreliable but sometimes surprisingly powerful projectile weapons. These and other traits
		again prove that survival is indeed a strong creative motivator. Common Derelict weapons include the Beamcaster,
		Battle Rifle, and Derelict Rail Weapons, and even some electromagnetic designs like the Riot Gun and Arc
		Thrower.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; Dirty Bomb Trap</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> Likely another product of Derelict Tinkerers, when triggered this bomb generates an unusually
		high concentration of electromagnetic waves across its radius, capable of disabling an entire squad. An
		increasing number of patrols sent deep into the Caves have fallen to a combination of these traps and subsequent
		ambushes.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; Dirty Datajack</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> A new type of short-range datajack presumably developed by Derelict Tinkerers. The design is
		novel, diverging significantly from those developed by my researchers. It is extremely quick to use, but falls
		apart with use. Patrols in the Caves have recently recovered several large caches of these, suggesting that
		Derelicts could be staging for some kind of attack.</p>
	<br>

	<br>
	<p class="lore-unknown">&gt; ???</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; Earth</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> Third planet from the Sun in the Solar System. Terrestrial homeworld of Human civilization.
		By the late 21st century that civilization drained the planet's resources and destabilized the environment to
		the point that global-scale technology was necessary to maintain an increasingly fragile planet.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; Epsilon Eridani System</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> Home to a spectral class K2 star 3.22 parsecs from the Sun, Epsilon Eridani is a young star
		system containing multiple rocky asteroid belts and a number of exoplanets potentially capable of supporting
		life. Destination of the ISCS Eridanus.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-unknown">&gt; ???</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-unknown">&gt; ???</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; Extension</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> Access to the Cetus Mainframe from Complex 0b1 has been sealed off, instead connecting it to
		the better-defended Complex 0b10 via this new tunnel network.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; Fabricator</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> Self-contained construction unit capable of building almost any component or robot for which
		detailed schematics are provided. An internal generator provides all the energy required for fabrication, but
		matter input is drawn from the local network as per fabricator specification, while some schematics may call for
		preassembled subcomponents. Advanced fabricators can complete complex tasks more quickly.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-unknown">&gt; ???</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-unknown">&gt; ???</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; Flamer</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> Flamers may prompt me to rethink a large number of robot designs, as most are weak against
		sustained high temperatures caused by this primitive weapon, and often shut down or malfunction during
		confrontations with those Derelicts that employ them. The plasma variant on the Dragon prototype is particularly
		worrisome.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; Garrison</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> Network of corridors linking Complex 0b10 zones to facilitate movement of combat squads
		responding to threats. Major entrances are reinforced Garrison Access points. Garrisons also house the relays
		responsible for transmitting commands and remotely augmenting the system defenses of activated squads.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; Garrison Access</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> Heavy doorways serving as points of entry and exit from Garrison corridor networks. To ensure
		safe passage of response squads entering a potential hostile fire zone, the installation itself is reinforced
		against explosives and kinetic weaponry that might otherwise inflict excessive collateral damage. Corresponding
		defensive measures have rendered it somewhat weak against thermal attacks. For emergency situations where an
		area has been overrun, or a garrison has been infiltrated, the entrance and inner tunnel may be permanently
		sealed to prevent passage and contain the threat.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-unknown">&gt; ???</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-unknown">&gt; ???</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; Heroes of Zion</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> There are sporadic reports of fairly powerful Derelicts operating in the caves, mostly in a
		defensive capacity to protect harmless robots against indiscriminatory 0b10 patrols. Dubbed "Heroes of Zion,"
		there probably aren't more than a few of them but I may need to dispatch the Unchained to hunt them down if
		reports of their effectiveness are confirmed. "Zion" must be one of the remaining nearby Derelict communities.
		Perhaps a few interrogations there will yield more specific information.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; High Security</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> Due to the increasing rate of attacks by powerful lone wolf Derelicts entering Complex 0b10,
		presumably seeking high-tech components or useful data, I've established a new alert level focused on their
		destruction or, if possible, capture. For this purpose I've also authorized the use of Containment Facilitator
		technology outside its normal Testing environment.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-unknown">&gt; ???</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; Human</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> Homo sapiens, dominant species in the Solar System until civilization in that system was
		presumably wiped out during the Solar War.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-unknown">&gt; ???</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-unknown">&gt; ???</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; Hypervelocity Weapons</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> Successful experiments in maintaining the stability of highly compressed matter during
		high-velocity impact events have enabled the creation of weapons that can accelerate projectiles to greater
		speeds for penetrating multiple targets. Many new railgun-type ballistic weapons have alternate hypervelocity
		variants that inflict less collateral damage in exchange for the potential to strike more than one target and
		reach critical systems, or even bore through thick walls to strike targets on the other side. A unique
		application of this technique was used in the design of the Hypervelocity EM Gauss Rifle.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; ISC</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> International Space Command. A Human organization formed in 2080, tasked with overseeing
		efforts to explore and colonize the Solar System. Fair bargaining mechanisms within the ISC fostered cooperation
		among members, and rapid advances were made within a short time span during the 21st century, culminating with
		the launch of the Interstellar Exploration Fleet in 2140.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-unknown">&gt; ???</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; ISCS Cetus</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> Launched as part of the Interstellar Exploration Fleet in 2140, the Cetus arrived in the Tau
		Ceti System in 2211. The Cetus crew and cargo were the most diverse of the fleet, incorporating a variety of
		civilian, science, and military personnel intended to colonize Tau Ceti IV, but the ship continued past its
		destination after deploying Project Seraph that year.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-unknown">&gt; ???</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; ISCS Leo</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> Launched as part of the Interstellar Exploration Fleet in 2140, the Leo was scheduled to
		arrive in the Wolf 359 System in 2185. It presumably arrived as intended, though the distance is too great to
		have received any communications to that effect. A significant portion of the Leo's crew were science personnel,
		with a cargo including advanced factories and terraforming modules.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; Infestation</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> The Mines and some outlying branches of Complex 0b10 are seeing increasing numbers of a new
		threat: The Assembled. Until there is sufficient data to discern a pattern behind their movements, Demolisher
		response squads are the only effective solution, short of making structural changes that would affect the
		efficiency of the entire complex. Locating the source of the Assemblers is becoming an urgent priority. They are
		rarely seen in the lowest levels, though this could be purely due to reduced surveillance capabilities in those
		areas. Encounters are more frequent in mid-levels where they are more easily dealt with, suggesting they are
		originating from deeper in the Caves, which extend furthest at those depths.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; Interstellar Exploration Fleet</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> Built under the direction of the ISC beginning in 2080, the fleet consists of the only four
		Titan class ships ever constructed: ISCS Leo, ISCS Centaurus, ISCS Eridanus, and ISCS Cetus, all of which
		departed the Solar System in 2140. After a year of joint maneuvers during which on-board systems underwent
		extensive testing, the four ships set off for their respective destinations.</p>

	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; Lightweight Power Sources</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> Many engines, cores, and reactors have an alternative lightweight variant that retains the
		generation efficiency of its standard version but minimizes built-in battery space to reduce weight for certain
		robot designs, especially those with strict weight restrictions such as hovering and flight-based models.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; MAIN.C</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> Ha ha ha. </p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; Materials</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> At the deepest levels of Complex 0b10, raw materials are processed for use in manufacturing
		components and machines. Older technology and prototypes are gradually filtered down to these levels, and older
		robot variants are responsible for their oversight and maintenance.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-unknown">&gt; ???</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; Mines</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> Deep underground areas newly excavated to provide access to raw materials for processing in
		the lower levels of Complex 0b10. Initially the mining tunnels only rarely experienced hostile Derelict
		activity, not enough to justify allocating significant resources to defense. This has recently changed with the
		Infestation, for which the current response is to dispatch garrisoned Demolishers until a more permanent
		solution can be put in place.</p>

	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; Recycling</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> Storage area extension to which obsolete technology is transferred for conversion to raw
		materials. Derelicts from deeper caves have recently begun using this as a convenience route for quick access to
		the Factory floors, thus a more secure access system was put in place to at least keep out the stupid ones which
		tend to cause more trouble.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; Recycling Unit</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> Deconstruction apparatus for breaking down old components delivered by Recycler class robots.
		Condensed matter is contained within the unit until it reaches a certain quota, at which point it is transferred
		to the nearest DSF.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-unknown">&gt; ???</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; Repair Station</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> Self-contained repair facility capable of restoring the integrity of damaged components.
		Serious internal issues such as prototype malfunction and component deterioration are beyond the scope of
		repair. Advanced repair stations can complete complex tasks more quickly.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-unknown">&gt; ???</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; Riot Gun</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> This weapon is without a doubt based on the EM shotgun, though heavily modified to
		concentrate a greater electromagnetic burst within a much shorter range. As these are the primary armament of
		Derelict wizards, combat protocol dictates that units engage them at extreme range whenever possible.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-unknown">&gt; ???</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; Scanalyzer</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> Comprehensive suite of scanning and analysis tools for diagnosing prototype malfunctions,
		examining the properties of self-developed Derelict components, and reverse engineering technology recovered
		from the surface battle site. Capable of producing schematics for components scanned, though multiple scans may
		be required and the deconstruction process may render the component itself useless. Advanced scanalyzers are
		equipped with a wider array of devices for more quickly and safely analyzing esoteric technologies.</p>

	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; Seraph</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> One of many contingency plans devised on the ISCS Cetus meant to one day deal with a
		potential alien threat. Project Seraph was deployed in 2211 in response to the 2210 ISC message from Earth. A
		powerful artificial intelligence dubbed "MAIN.C" was put in control of one of the ship's manufacturing
		facilities which was then detached and dropped on Tau Ceti IV. Its goal was to build a false civilization and
		construct facilities to mimic the presence of human activity on the planet in order to lure the Sigix there and
		eliminate them or at least learn their weaknesses. Any information gained through this organically self-designed
		experiment was to be broadcasted in as many directions as possible to alert any surviving Humans.</p>

	<p class="lore-known"> Interactive station connected to the central network via reliable hard line. Relevant
		information is monitored and relayed by the terminal's Operator. Types of information accessible directly from

	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; AA04 Analysis</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> When activated, all matter in a small bubble around this device is teleported to a new
		position. I've discovered a way to not only replicate the technology but also partially control the destination
		over a longer distance, something the Sigix were likely capable of as well but required the use of supplementary
		devices. MAIN.C has correctly analyzed the underlying principles of its functionality, but has so far been
		unable to build its own due to repeated network sabotage from an unknown source. This is probably for the
		better, though it's concerning that I don't know anyone capable of doing this besides myself. And it's not me...
	</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; AA07 Analysis</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> The Sigix stocked their ship with a number of unused independent modules designed to augment
		the capabilities of various components of their ship, presumably for repairs or to handle otherwise unexpected
		situations. Without access to the craft itself, I'm unable to determine what component this particular module is
		intended for, but MAIN.C data points to it being one of many associated with the FTL drive, most likely related
		to energy or heat transfer.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; Command</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> While direct access to MAIN.C's personal facility would no doubt benefit my efforts here, it
		is too dangerous to enter given that some local installation is inhibiting teleportation into, and presumably
		out of, the entire area. Nonetheless, it won't be long before I can develop a way to overcome it.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; Hidden Lab</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> I've discovered an unusual area that appears to be an authorized structure built by 0b10
		robots, but is completely sealed off from the rest of the complex. Moreover, it's right under MAIN.C's nose just
		off the Armory. Careful use of artifact AA04 allowed me to slip inside without disturbing anything, but the area
		was deserted and none of the machines were accessible at the time, despite showing signs of fresh use. Once
		inside I was able to at least determine the access code, however: &lt;CODE&gt;.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; Live Specimen</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> MAIN.C captured one of the Sigix! I know generally where it's located, but all information
		about the find must have been isolated on the local network, because I've never seen any more detailed records.
		I also haven't been able to get close enough since security across Research levels was vastly increased
		following recent thefts. Including my own, I admit! I'm considering risking an outright confrontation to gain
		access, but am severely understaffed for anything but covert operations. It might be time to reappropriate the
		0b10 fabrication network. I must see that alien.</p>

	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; Log 2243.053.001</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> I've never seen anything like it. There was almost no advance warning before the small Sigix
		ship swooped down through the lower atmosphere to touch down on the surface. It landed just above some hidden
		tunnels, and immediately after the doors opened and its crew emerged, both they and it were swarmed by a massive
		army of robots that burst from underground. The aliens in their heavily armored exoskeletons were unperturbed at
		first, leaving the relative safety of their ship to wade through MAIN.C's forces, slicing many in two with
		massive swords, firing blazing fast energy weapons capable of ripping pieces clean off the target. Most of the
		fighting occurred above ground, and only hours later did even the first of the aliens finally succumb to enemy
		fire. By then the ship had been sabotaged from the inside. Without a spaceworthy ship the Sigix have no choice
		but to fight for survival. I'm so proud.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; Log 2243.053.002</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> It's become an even deadlier battle now that the Sigix realize they've underestimated the

	<p class="lore-known"> A spectacular battle is being followed by a spectacularly fast recovery. MAIN.C hasn't been

	<p class="lore-known"> Due to the long period of neglect, wild experiments and old robot designs inhabiting the

	<p class="lore-known"> MAIN.C's frantic pace of research and development still shows no signs of slowing. I've begun
		hacking peripheral systems to learn what I can about what's going on. Reliable information is tough to come by,
		though I'm certain that MAIN.C's current primary goal is to repair the ship. It seems concerned solely with
		self-preservation, and armed with this new technology could even one day become a threat to whatever is left of

	<p class="lore-known"> With more and more surprises popping up lately, frequently hacking MAIN.C data has become

	<br>
	<p class="lore-known-title">&gt; SGEMP Prototype</p>
	<p class="lore-known"> Recent evidence indicates that MAIN.C is working on a new weapon of mass destruction, a
		system-generated electromagnetic pulse, likely as a last-ditch defensive weapon. If properly configured it could
		theoretically fry every system across a huge area except MAIN.C itself, and any other robot with in-built
		immunity. This could even pose a threat to me until I learn exactly how it works. It's also likely I could
		analyze it and use that knowledge against MAIN.C itself. The latest prototype is currently located in Testing,

		system, or seek to ruin it for others. They are a natural byproduct of such a random system, not unlike human
		nature and society from which we derived our methods. / But we continue to improve ourselves despite occasional
		setbacks. / New Derelicts created here are bestowed with a randomized unique personality derived from this

	<p class="lore-known"> The Alpha 7 is a prototype for a new class of combat robot, very accurate with its multirail
		and heavy quantum rifle. Some experimental variants instead use an enhanced gamma rifle. Alpha 7s are built with
		strong defensive capabilities and triple-encased core technology, enabling them to easily take on multiple
		opponents simultaneously, while a more advanced version of the behemoth-style critical failure prevention system
		provides the same advantages in a smaller frame.</p>

		advanced reaction system makes the Striker more difficult to hit on approach despite its large size. The plasma
		lance is highly effective at skewering target cores.</p>
